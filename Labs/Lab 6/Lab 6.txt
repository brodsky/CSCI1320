1. When you open up the Terminal it starts at the root directory. Create a new
directory here for keeping your C++ coding (in case you want to use JH for other
things in the future, let’s create a directory specifically for C++ coding.) Call it
something like myCpp or cppProjects.

	1a. To create a directory inside the root directory, run the following command: "mkdir cppProjects"

2. Within this directory, create a new text file. Make this file be a C++ cheat sheet
where you will record snippets of syntax to use as a reference as you learn C++.

	2a. Enter into the directory you just created with the following command: "cd cppProjects"
	2b. Create an empty .txt file with the following command: "touch cppCheatSheet.txt"

3. Now create a new directory within this directory for lab 6 and assignment 6.

	3a. Make a directory inside the current directory for Lab 6 and Assignment 6 with the following command: "mkdir ./lab+assignment6"

4. Create a file called hello.cpp.

	4a. Enter into the directory you just created with the following command: "cd lab+assignment6"
	4b.  Create a C++ file called "hello.cpp" with the following command: touch "hello.cpp" 

5. Actually, delete the file from step 4.

	5a. Delete "hello.cpp" with the following command: "rm hello.cpp"

6. Create a file called <lastName>Lab6.cpp (e.g. zagrodzkiLab6.cpp).

	6a. Create a C++ file titled brodskyLab6.cpp with the following command: "touch brodskyLab6.cpp"

7. Do quick check to make sure only the one file you expect exists in the current
directory.

	7a. Run "ls" from the command window to see what files are in the current directory (lab+assignment6). Ensure that only the the file "brodskyLab6.cpp" is shown.

8. Now open your file from step 6 so that you can edit it (do this outside of Terminal -
just double click the newly created file under the “Files” tab.) Copy the code from the
attached myNameIs.cpp file. Only change the file such that your name is displayed.

	8a. In the "Files" tab, click on the "cppProjects" directory, then click on the "lab+assignment6" directory. Open the file "brodskyLab6.cpp" and ensure that it is empty.
	8b. Paste the following code into "brodskyLab6.cpp":

		#include <iostream>
		using namespace std;

		int main()
		{
    			cout << "My name is Andrew Brodsky" << endl;
    			return 0;
		}


9. Compile the file and give the executable some custom name.

	9a. Save and close the file "brodskyLab6.cpp".
	9b. Compile "brodskyLab6.cpp" into an executable called "brodskyLab6Executable.out" with the following command:

		g++ brodskyLab6.cpp -o brodskyLab6Executable.out

10. Run the executable program from step 9.

	10a. In the terminal, type the following command to run "brodskyLab6Executable.out":

		./brodskyLab6Executable.out

	The text "My name is Andrew Brodsky" should appear in the command window.

11. Create a zip file only containing your source code file.

	11a. Go up one directory level with the following command: "cd .."
	11b. Zip the directory "lab+assignment6" with the following command: "zip -r lab6Zip.zip lab+assignment6 -x \*.out"

12. Download the zip file.

	12. Right-click on the zip file called "brodskyLab6Zip.zip" and choose "Download".
